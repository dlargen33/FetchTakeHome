### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features
This solution implements the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern with a structured, layered approach to ensure modularity, testability, and maintainability. The architecture follows a View → ViewModel → Service → Networking/Data Access flow, clearly separating concerns.

Architectural Overview:
	1.	View: Displays UI components and observes ViewModel state.
	2.	ViewModel: Contains presentation logic, interacts with the Service layer, and exposes data to the View.
	3.	Service Layer: Acts as an intermediary between the ViewModel and underlying data sources (API & local storage).
	4.	Networking & Data Access Layer: Handles API communication and Core Data persistence.

Key Features:
	•	MVVM with a Clean Service Layer: Ensures that ViewModels remain lightweight and only depend on abstracted services.
	•	Networking Integration: Fetches remote data from an API efficiently.
	•	Core Data Storage: Caches relevant data for offline access.
	•	Separation of Concerns: Each layer is responsible for a distinct function, making the codebase scalable and maintainable.
